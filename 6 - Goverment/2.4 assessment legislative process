[TOC]

### The Creation of a Bill
Either the House of Representatives or the Senate will introduce the idea of a *bill*<sup>1</sup>.

### Committee Action
*Committees*<sup>2</sup> will organise subcommittees within itself to investigate the bill and reccomend the best course of action. This revision of the bill could include things such as hearings of experts or *tabling*<sup>3</sup> the bill itself.

### Floor Action
The bill is turned to whichever chamber of congress didn't introduce the idea of the bill. They then make alterations to the bill.

### Vote
Both the Senate and House of Representatives will vote on their respective version of the bill.

### Conference Committees
After both houses agree to their varients of the bill, a *Conference Committee*<sup>4</sup> will compormise between the two. A final draft with features from both versions will be drafted.

### Presidential Action
The final draft will be passed to the President where it can either be passed or vetoed. If passed, the bill will be turned into law. If vetoed, the bill may be sent back to congress for further changes.

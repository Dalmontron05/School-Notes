### Laws / Separation of Powers
> There are three branches of government: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.
The Legislative branch is responsible for the creation of laws. They can create or be presented with a bill, and then from there they can turn down or adjust a bill. Adjustments to not-immediately-thrown-out bills are made to make sure it is compliant with the constitution and meets the majorityâ€™s demands.
The Executive branch is responsible for the application of the law. They are who determine if someone should be presented before the legislative branch, in order to help keep security among the public. These laws are enforced through authorities such as police or departments such as the CIA.
The Judicial branch is responsible for the interpretation of the law. They decide if someone prosecuted for the breakage of a law is actually guilty or not. If so, they are punished accordingly. There are two types of courtage, federal and state.

### Checks and Balances
> All branches have a way of controlling each other should the need ever arise. Members of the executive branch can be tried for any severe unjust actions they make. Judicial members can be thrown out for nonsensical decision-making by their peers or other branches. Legislative branch members can also be thrown out by their peers for nonsensical decisions, but can be tried by the Judicial branch if

## 1.3 Average Rate of Change - edpuzzle notes

[TOC]

### Linear
**change is consistant**

Equations must first be changed into the $$y = mx + b$$ format. The $$m$$ is the slope

Slope = $$\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

- *Graphs*: The line is straight. The "rise" and "run" are the same between points.
- *Tables*: The value between entries in the table are the same in their respective columns

### Non-Linear
Given a function $$y = f(x)$$ the average rate of change of $$f$$ from $$a$$ to $$b$$ is defined as
$$\frac{change in  y}{change in x}=\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

> This is pretty similar to the linear slope function where instead of $$x$$ and $$y$$, it's now $$a$$ and $$b$$ Now though, you're finding the average change in slope. ![](https://imgur.com/QqFgsoJ.png)

You first find the two points you need by plugging in their $$x$$'s in the function to determine the missing $$y$$'s. Then, you find the slope by subtracting the $$y$$'s and $$x$$'s. Lastly, you use point slope form: $$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

here's an example with variables

For using your average rate of change from one question in another question, they both must be the same function and start from the same $$x_1$$

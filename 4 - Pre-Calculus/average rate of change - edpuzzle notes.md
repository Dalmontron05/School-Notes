## 1.3 Average Rate of Change - edpuzzle notes

[TOC]

### Linear
**change is consistant**

Equations must first be changed into the $y = mx + b$ format. The $m$ is the slope

Slope = $$\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

- *Graphs*: The line is straight. The "rise" and "run" are the same between points.
- *Tables*: The value between entries in the table are the same in their respective columns

### Non-Linear
Given a function $y = f(x)$ the average rate of change of $f$ from $a$ to $b$ is defined as
$$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}$$

> This is pretty similar to the linear slope function where instead of $x$ and $y$, it's now $a$ and $b$ Now though, you're finding the average change in slope. ![](https://imgur.com/QqFgsoJ.png)

You first find the two points you need by plugging in their $x$'s in the function to determine the missing $y$'s. Then, you find the slope by subtracting the $y$'s and $x$'s. Lastly, you use point slope form: $$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$

For using your average rate of change from one question in another question, they both must be the same function and start from the same $x_1$

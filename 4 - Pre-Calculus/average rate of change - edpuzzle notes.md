## 1.3 Average Rate of Change - edpuzzle notes

[TOC]

### Linear
**change is consistant**

Equations must first be changed into the $$y = mx + b$$ format. The $$m$$ is the slope

Slope = $$\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

- *Graphs*: The line is straight. The "rise" and "run" are the same between points.
- *Tables*: The value between entries in the table are the same in their respective columns

### Non-Linear
